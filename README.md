# Abstract
Many lives depend on the availability of a proper blood bag. A healthy person can donate up to 350 ml every three months which helps save up to 3 lives. The blood supply is stored in a blood bank after donation. When a patient is in need of a blood transfer. A request is sent to the bank. However, some of the blood types supply runs out. That is where our problem starts. The patient’s family might start to spread messages for friends and relatives to donate. The blood donation process tends to be complicated and time-consuming. Especially, for rare blood types demands. A life might be lost in this lengthy process. This solution is clearly not as effective as it needs to be. In order to achieve this goal, a system that connects doners with patients is needed, where the system administers donors’ personal information and blood type. Our work aims, to create a bloodline system. Encouraging individual in our society to register as donors. Guaranteeing easy access to emergency donors whenever a shortage in blood supplies happens. Facilitating the searching process of a specific blood group through connecting the system to a centralized database where the information of all doners is stored. Delivering blood to patients in a fast-reliable way by sharing contact information of doners. Making the data of the doner available in one place. Utilizing current technologies to find the solution of today’s issues.
